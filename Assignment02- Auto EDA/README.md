# Book Dataset Analysis with Sweetviz

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a book dataset using the Sweetviz library. Sweetviz is an open-source Python library that creates beautiful, high-density visualizations for a quick and easy EDA.

## Dataset
The dataset features information on over 11,000 books, providing details such as title, authors, average rating, ISBN numbers, language codes, number of pages, publication dates, and publishers.

## Analysis Highlights

- **General Overview**: The dataset comprises 11,123 books with 12 distinct features. These features are a mix of categorical, numerical, and text-based attributes.
   
- **Unique Identifiers**: Both `bookID` and the `isbn` & `isbn13` numbers act as unique identifiers for books. They play a pivotal role in ensuring data integrity.
   
- **Diversity in Titles and Authors**: About 93% of books have unique titles, and around 60% have unique authors. Some prolific authors, like Stephen King, have multiple entries, suggesting different editions or a vast bibliography.
   
- **Language Distribution**: A significant portion of the dataset (80%) comprises books written in English. However, the dataset also represents a myriad of other languages.
   
- **Publication Patterns**: The dataset offers a temporal view of book publications. Some specific dates see a surge in book releases, suggesting possible trend patterns in the publishing world.
   
- **Ratings and Reviews**: The average rating across books is close to 4 out of 5. There's a strong correlation between the number of ratings a book has and the number of text reviews it has received.
   
- **Prominent Publishers**: The dataset showcases several well-known publishers, with entities like Vintage, Penguin Books, and Penguin Classics leading the charge.
